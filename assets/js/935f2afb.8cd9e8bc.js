As a site scales up, Firebase services do have a cost. However, this is a great solution for smaller portfolio sites. If you do end up building a site that scales, that can be a good problem to have - perhaps you have the beginnings of a start-up. If so, a cloud-based solution like Firebase will help with many of the headaches that scaling up can cause, ranging from efficient database queries to fast hosting.","sidebar":"fidgetech-4-react"},"fidgetech-4-react/react-with-nosql/4322-firestore-queries":{"id":"fidgetech-4-react/react-with-nosql/4322-firestore-queries","title":"\ud83d\udcd3 4.3.2.2 Firestore Queries","description":"As our data gets more complex, we\'ll want to use queries to filter our data.
