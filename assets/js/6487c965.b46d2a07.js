We explored this concept further in C#/.NET. A quick refresher: inheritance is when a child object gains the functionality of a parent object.

For instance, objects from a ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Cat")," class could inherit from a ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Mammal")," class and so on. In the case of JavaScript, that functionality is passed down via prototypal inheritance, though we have the syntactic sugar of classes with ES6."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"There are some issues with inheritance, however. One big issue is that it doesn't always make sense for an object to inherit all the functionality of another kind of object. This is more of an issue with classical inheritance, since prototypal inheritance can be targeted to individual objects and not just classes. As our codebases get more complex, we could end up in a situation where we're stuck giving objects all kinds of functionality that they don't need - and some of that unneeded functionality could lead to bugs as well as code that's hard to understand. Joe Armstrong, the creator of the functional language Erlang, has the perfect quote for this issue: \"You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.\""),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"There are several other issues with classical inheritance. Imagine you're building an application that characterizes the behavior of various mammals. For that reason, you decide to start with a ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Mammal")," class and to add various methods that should presumably apply to all mammals. As your application begins to grow, however, not all the methods apply to all of the mammals inheriting from the ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Mammal")," class. After all, there's a lot of variance in the animal kingdom - and by the time you need to add a ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Platypus")," class, the entire application is in desperate need of a refactor. If only the ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Reptile")," and ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Bird")," classes allow for egg-laying methods, how would that method be incorporated into ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Platypus"),"? Not only is a ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Platypus")," neither type of animal, but it's already inheriting from another class, anyway."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"The problem here is that classical inheritance forces us to add functionality up front that may cause us problems further down the road.

Unfortunately, classical inheritance isn't very flexible."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"This is because inheritance ",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"tightly couples")," classes and their objects. A piece of code is tightly coupled to another piece of code when they are reliant on each other for functionality.
